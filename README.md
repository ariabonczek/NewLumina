# NewLumina
A 3D game engine written in C++ utilizing DirectX11, DirectX12, and OpenGL4.3

Development is currently running on the "DirectX11" branch, which will be merged with the main branch once it has been made safe for DirectX12 and OpenGL build modes. If you would like to see the most up to date version, please select that branch as the main branch will not give an up to date version of the project.
